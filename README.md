# Expanding Menu Project

Having glimpsed a pop-out menu project somewhere on the web for all of about 30 seconds (I couldn't find it again) I set out to replicate it (or something similar) for the sake of some practice.

Currently it pops out and displays menu items on a click. It retracts on another click to display only the icons for the menu. 

I've not yet coded the link functionality of the menu so nothing goes anywhere. 

[There is a live version here](#).
